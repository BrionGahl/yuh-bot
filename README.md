## Goal / Purpose

The ideas behind the creation of this bot are listed below:
- consolidate bots in my Discord servers
- learn and experiment with Rust

The bot is written with the `poise` crate and uses a few others for requests / logging sinks.

## Features

- **WoW Guild** — Bart Timeline Reminders addon info, class Discord links, and droptimizer report submission via WowUtils
- **Gambling** — multiplayer roll sessions with a lobby and results embed
- **Clips channels** — deletes any message posted in a configured channel that doesn't contain a video (uploaded video file or an unfurled video link embed)
- **Personal officer channels** — when a member is given the trial or raider role, creates a private text channel for them under a configured category, visible only to them and the officer (moderator) role

## Deployment

The bot is packaged as a Docker image and deployed via GitHub Actions to Cloud Run on GCP.

On every push to `master`, the workflow:
1. Builds the image using a multi-stage Rust build with `cargo-chef` for dependency caching
2. Pushes it to Google Artifact Registry
3. Deploys it to Cloud Run, pinned to exactly one always-on instance with CPU throttling disabled
4. Deletes old Cloud Run revisions, keeping only the one now serving traffic and the one before it
   (a manual rollback target)

The bot has no HTTP API of its own — it only holds a persistent Discord gateway connection — so it
runs a minimal HTTP listener (`src/health.rs`) purely to satisfy Cloud Run's container startup check.

See `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for the full workflow, and the [Cloud Run setup](#one-time-cloud-run-setup)
section below for the one-time GCP configuration this requires.

### Tearing down

`.github/workflows/teardown.yml` is a manually-triggered workflow (`Actions` tab → `Teardown Cloud Run` →
`Run workflow`) that deletes the `gulp-bot` Cloud Run service. It requires typing `gulp-bot` into the
confirmation input, or the job fails before touching anything. It only deletes the Cloud Run service —
pushed images stay in Artifact Registry, and the next push to `master` will recreate the service.

### One-time Cloud Run setup

This is manual GCP configuration that only needs to happen once (or once per environment), not
something the workflow does for you:

1. Enable the Cloud Run API on the project: `gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com --project=<PROJECT_ID>`.
2. Grant the WIF deploy service account (`secrets.WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`) the roles needed to deploy to Cloud Run:
   ```shell
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <PROJECT_ID> \
     --member="serviceAccount:<WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT>" --role="roles/run.admin"
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <PROJECT_ID> \
     --member="serviceAccount:<WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT>" --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountUser"
   ```
3. In the GitHub repo, set these Actions **variables** (`Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Variables`)
   alongside the existing `GCP_REGION` / `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: `BOT_NAME`, `MOD_ROLE_ID`, `RAIDER_ROLE_ID`,
   `TRIAL_ROLE_ID`, `PERSONAL_OFFICER_CATEGORY_ID`, `CLIPS_CHANNEL_IDS`, `RAID_NOTES_CHANNEL_ID`,
   `LOG_LEVEL`, `WOWUTILS_GROUP_ID`. Optionally `REPLAY_USER_ID`.
4. Set these Actions **secrets** (`Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Secrets`):
   `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `BART_TOKEN`, `WOWUTILS_TOKEN`. They're passed to the Cloud Run service as plain
   environment variables at deploy time — GitHub masks them in workflow logs, but anyone with viewer
   access to the Cloud Run service in the GCP console can read them back out of its revision config.
   If that's ever a concern, Secret Manager is the more locked-down alternative.
5. The old `GCE_INSTANCE` / `GCE_ZONE` variables and the Compute Engine instance itself are no longer
   used and can be decommissioned once the first Cloud Run deploy succeeds.

## Using the bot

### Environment Variables

```shell
# Discord
DISCORD_TOKEN=<bot token>
BOT_NAME=<display name used in embeds>
MOD_ROLE_ID=<Discord role ID, also treated as the "officer" role for personal officer channels>
RAIDER_ROLE_ID=<Discord role ID>
TRIAL_ROLE_ID=<Discord role ID>
PERSONAL_OFFICER_CATEGORY_ID=<Discord category channel ID that personal officer channels are created under>

# WowUtils
WOWUTILS_TOKEN=<WowUtils API token, sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`>
WOWUTILS_GROUP_ID=<WowUtils group ID that droptimizer reports are submitted to>

# Clips channels
CLIPS_CHANNEL_IDS=<comma-separated list of Discord channel IDs to restrict to video-only messages, e.g. 123,456>

# Weekly raid notes
RAID_NOTES_CHANNEL_ID=<Discord forum channel ID to post weekly raid notes threads into>

# Delete-and-replay (optional)
REPLAY_USER_ID=<Discord user ID whose self-deleted messages the bot reposts>
```

Note: the bot needs the **Manage Messages** permission in any channel listed in `CLIPS_CHANNEL_IDS` to delete non-video messages.

### Delete-and-replay

If `REPLAY_USER_ID` is set, the bot keeps the last few messages that user posts in memory, and
when one of them is deleted it reposts the content in the same channel as an embed (author line
with their name/avatar, the message text as the description, the original timestamp, and the
first image attachment rendered inline — other attachments are listed as links). It **doesn't**
repost if the guild audit log shows a moderator deleted the message: a user deleting their own
message leaves no audit log entry, so any entry for the deletion is taken to mean someone else (a
moderator) removed it. Bulk deletes (channel purges) are always treated as moderator actions and
never replayed. Reposts suppress all mentions, so a deleted `@everyone` won't re-ping on replay.
The bot needs the **View Audit Log** permission for the moderator check; without it, every
deletion is replayed. Only messages seen since the bot last started are recoverable, and
attachment links may 404 shortly after deletion. See `src/message_replay.rs`.

### Personal officer channels

When a member is given the `TRIAL_ROLE_ID` or `RAIDER_ROLE_ID` role, the bot creates a private text
channel for them under the category set by `PERSONAL_OFFICER_CATEGORY_ID`, named `<their name>-officer-chat`.
The channel is only visible to that member and to anyone with `MOD_ROLE_ID` (treated as the officer
role) — `@everyone` is explicitly denied `View Channel`. The bot tags the channel by embedding the
member's mention in its topic, so if they gain the other role later (e.g. trial promoted to raider) it
won't create a second channel. Losing the role does **not** delete or archive the channel — that's left
to officers to do manually. The bot needs the **Manage Channels** permission and must be able to see
the `PERSONAL_OFFICER_CATEGORY_ID` category. See `src/personal_officer_channels.rs`.

### Weekly raid notes

Every Tuesday at 9:00 AM Eastern (DST-aware, via `America/New_York`), the bot creates a new forum
post titled `Week of <Mon> <day> - <Sun> <day>` in the channel set by `RAID_NOTES_CHANNEL_ID`, with a
placeholder starter message. `RAID_NOTES_CHANNEL_ID` must point at a **forum channel** — the bot needs
permission to create posts there. See `src/raid_notes.rs`.
